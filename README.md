 Abstract: We examined the evolutionary history of hornworts with sequences from 234 nuclear genes, sampling 79 hornwort specimens, including representatives of all five orders and eleven hornwort genera. Our results revealead surprising insights into the placement of Leiosporoceros, the putative sister lineage to the other hornworts. Placement of Leiosporoceros is complicated due to extreme levels of gene tree incon-gruence, likely resulting from ILS and ancient reticulation, the latter identified using a network approach to identify evidence of gene flow among hornwort lineages. Our analyses revealed that divergences within hornwort lineages, particularly during the mid-Cretaceous and Paleogene, correlating with the mass extinction near the Creta-ceous-Paleogene boundary. Similarly, our findings align with changes observed in oth-er groups during this period (e.g., mosses, ferns, and gymnosperms) highlighting a parallel pattern of diversification. Additionally, we showed that hornworts likely originated in Carboniferous, coinciding with a significant decline in atmospheric CO2 levels during the Devonian. As suggested across nearly all photosynthetic organisms possessing pyrenoid, it’s likely that the hornwort pyrenoid, potentially evolved in the common ancestor of the group in response to the substantial drop in atmospheric CO2 levels
